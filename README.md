The videos of the data (both squats and lunges) are present in the videos folder. 

The CSV data for the squats is available in the CSV folder. 

The labels from the personal trainers are in the labels folder for both squats and lunges.

There was an issue uploading the Optitrack takes and the lunge CSV files. Once this is resolved these files will also be present.

The code is uploaded in Jupyter Notebook form in order to make this repository function like a walkthrough.
